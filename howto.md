# How to make a mask

There are many designs online but simple is best. The instructions below for a simple mask can be adapted depending on what you have available.  Tightly woven cotton fabric is best.  If you don't have flannel for the lining, use two layers of cotton fabric. If you don't have elastic, use bias tape or fabric to edge the short end of the mask and make 10-12" ties on each corner.
